# Rushes_Log_Filler
Gets info from rushes rolls.

In TV we are regularly given hard drives that will have media from several different 
camera cards labelled up and organised into their own folders.

For example on a drive you could have folders labelled as such:

CAMA_190920_FS7_001
CAMB_190920_FS7_002
GOP1_190921_GO_001

Inside these folders there may be multiple folders & files that aren't necessarily relevant for logging, 
i.e. not media that can be cut with in a Non-Linear Editing Software.

What rushes_log_filler does is take the information at the root of each folder (the name)
finds all of the generally recognised media files within said folder (or roll)
and then provides that information, tab separated so it can be copied from the console into 
your excel spreadsheet. Work like this is normally done manuall, and with hundreds of rolls a day, takes hours.
